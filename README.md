Tableau Hospitality Domain Insights

As a part of AtliQ Grands' strategic move in the hospitality industry, I have implemented "Business and Data Intelligence" to regain market share and revenue.

**Problem Statement:**
AtliQ Grands, a leading player in the hospitality sector in India, faced challenges in losing market share and revenue due to strategic competition and management decision-making inefficiencies.

**Dashboard Highlights:**
- Used slicers to filter data by city
- KPI cards for Revenue, RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy %, Realisation %
- Line chart depicting Trend by Key Metrics
- Key Metrics by day type (Weekday vs Weekend)
- Line and stacked line chart for Realisation and ADR by booking platform
- Tabular format for all key metrics across twenty-five properties

**Key Insights:**
- Dynamic Pricing Recommendation: Flat pricing observed despite occupancy fluctuations between weekdays and weekends. Suggesting a shift to dynamic pricing for increased revenue.
- Property Performance Analysis: Properties with high ADR and low Occupancy identified. Investigating these properties with ratings below 2.5 can unlock revenue potential.
